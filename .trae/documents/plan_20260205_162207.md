I will resolve the database authentication error by ensuring environment variables are loaded before the Prisma Client is instantiated.

### 1. Fix Environment Loading (`prisma/prisma.ts`)
- The error `SCRAM failure: bad auth` often occurs when the `DATABASE_URL` is not correctly loaded when Prisma Client is initialized.
- I will modify `prisma/prisma.ts` to import `dotenv` and call `dotenv.config()` **before** creating the `PrismaClient` instance. This guarantees that `process.env.DATABASE_URL` is available regardless of where `prisma` is imported.

### 2. Verify `src/index.ts`
- I will check `src/index.ts` to ensure it doesn't conflict with the new loading strategy (it shouldn't, calling `dotenv.config()` multiple times is safe).
- I will verify the import path of `prisma` is correct.

### 3. Verify Seeder (`src/seeders/planSeeder.ts`)
- No changes needed here, but the fix in `prisma.ts` will propagate to the seeder since it imports the same prisma instance.

### 4. Verification
- I will restart the server (conceptually, by letting the user know to restart).
- The `Successfully connected to database` message combined with the auth error strongly suggests the connection string was either missing or partial at the time of usage.
